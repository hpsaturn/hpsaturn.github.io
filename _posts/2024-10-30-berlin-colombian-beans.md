## Preparation

Well, for me the best beans its with pork meat and beacon. For that I shoud do the next:

First put 1kg of pork in a pressure cooker with a complete onion and complete tomatos and black beans or red beans (two cups), salt and pepper and some garlic (a bit) for 1h

After that, extract the onion and tomatos cut these very small joined with more leek onion (puerros) and tomato maybe more garlic, pepper and salt and re-introduce to the pot but now for 30 minutes without pressure, with the lid open a medium fire. If you want also add spice pepper.

If you want a bit sweet, you could add in the last step a small cube of "panela" (3x3x3 cms). I love this.

Other option for replace the "panela" is the African banano, that is different to the normal banano. That is a well replace of the latino-american banano. Only put one "banano maduro" in the last step in cubes. Not to much because it is sweet if the banano is black, but if it is more yellow is not too sweet but the flavor is different.

Of course, if you are vegan you only change the meat with something. This alternative is also so good and you can use it also with other side dishes.
