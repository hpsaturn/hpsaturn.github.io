## Target

Taking photos is part of everyone’s life, it brings joy, excitement and motivation. However, we noticed that there is still a gap between high quality cameras and today's internet technologies and social environments.

Today’s camera manufacturers create products with amazing sensors and stunning lenses which give users high quality images, but most of them don't provide a connection to the cloud and social networks. On the other side, cellphone manufacturers create amazing devices completely immersed in the cloud but with poor optics which give users low quality images.

Through years of working with experts on the field, we deeply understood photography as the art and science that it is. So we came up with the idea of building a device to make this experience even more exciting and friendly with new technologies and social trends. This is how Lumera idea came to life, to connect camera and phones through WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and bring a new world of possibilities..
