## Technologies

* `Motorola 68HC908`: Firmware developed in assembler on a Motorola `MC68HC908GP32` with a few code on `C`.<br/>
* `CodeWarrior`: IDE, compiler, debugger and in-circuit debugger.
* `Hp48`: Navigation software using a `Hewlett Packard Hp48` interfaced via Serial connection.<br/>
* `Jazz library`: Low level IDE, compiler and debugger for `SysRPL` and `Hp48 Saturn CPU assembler`.
   
## Target

Rally computer for amateur and professional rally teams. Using a Hp48 calculator the rally team enter de race variables and the software give the next information:

 - `Current position`, from odometer interfaced from car to hardware device with a switch sensor or hall effect sensor.
 - `Target position`, calculated for keep car synced.
 - `Distance offset`, calculated from current position and race data.
 - `Current track`, from race information.
 - `Multiple time mode`, track time, race time, start and end time, etc.
