<center><b>CanAirIO</b> Citizen Network for Air Quality Monitoring</center>

Citizen science project with mobile and fixed sensors for measuring air quality (PM 2.5) using [low-cost sensors](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware) and smartphones. Built with a `ESP32` module board and some particulate meters, Honeywell, Sensirion, Plantower, etc, interfaced with the [CanAirIO Android](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_android) client app.

## Technologies

I used two technologies mainly for this iniciative, ESP32 and Android with the next initial goals:

- PlatformIO and its continous integration system for firmware deployments
- Bluetooth low energy (BLE) GATT sever for communications on mobile tracks
- Hybrid implementation, WiFi and Bluetooth for get air quality with mobile and fixed stations
- Grafana and InfluxDb implementation on the ESP32 firmware for data storage, telemetry and data analysis
- Firebase on Android for real time on mobile tracks
- OTA firmware remote updates via FOTA implementation

## Why CanAirIO?

With this Initiative many people will be able to fight for air quality rights in many countries with these problems. CanAirIO uses mobile and fixed sensors to measure air quality with cell phones and low-cost technology. Right now we have a community on many places of the world using CanAirIO
