<center><b>CanAirIO</b> Citizen Network for Air Quality Monitoring</center>

Citizen science project with mobile and fixed sensors for measuring air quality (PM 2.5) using [low-cost sensors](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_firmware) and smartphones. Built with a `ESP32` module board and some particulate meters, Honeywell, Sensirion, Plantower, etc, interfaced with the [CanAirIO Android](https://github.com/kike-canaries/canairio_android) client app.

## Technologies

I used two technologies mainly for this iniciative, ESP32 and Android with the next goals:

- [x] PlatformIO for continous integration over firmware side
- [x] Bluetooth low energy (BLE) GATT sever for communications on mobile tracks
- [x] Hybrid implementation, WiFi and Bluetooth for get air quality mobile and fixed stations
- [x] InfluxDb libraries implementation on the ESP32 firmware for data storage
- [x] Firebase on Android for real time on mobile tracks
- [x] Grafana for get a basic device dashboad and visualization all data
- [x] Firebase cloud messages for device provisioning
- [x] OTA firmware remote updates via FOTA implementation
